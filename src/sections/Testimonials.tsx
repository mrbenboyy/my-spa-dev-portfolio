His knack for breaking down complex concepts into simple steps is unreal. If anyoneâ€™s going to thrive as a fullstack dev, itâ€™s him.",

When I asked him why heâ€™s obsessed with fullstack, he said, â€˜I want to build everything myselfâ€”no limits.â€™ Thatâ€™s Hakim for youâ€”always aiming higher",
